******************************
Use Git and GitHub
#	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When one initializes a repository, a folder is created in which git stores metadata for version control
	You need to do it with every new project, to allow version control to take place.

#	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a place in which files can be stored before the actual commit
	The value that it adds is a bit more control - making logical changes to the repository

#	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By adding all files there which were changed during the logical change and then commit them all at one
	
#	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When you'd like to experiment and like to keep a working version of your project
	When you'd like to make the same program run in two different languages

# 	How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They show when and where vranches were created and what parents they have
	
#	What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	The result is that all changes made in both branches are committed into one version of the project
	It is represented the way it is, because in both branches different things have happenedand when they merge again, 
	only one branch is left
