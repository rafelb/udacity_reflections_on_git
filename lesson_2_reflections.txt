******************************
Use Git and GitHub
#	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When one initializes a repository, a folder is created in which git stores metadata for version control
	You need to do it with every new project, to allow version control to take place.

#	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a place in which files can be stored before the actual commit
	The value that it adds is a bit more control - making logical changes to the repository
